      Throws a SecurityException if the
      calling thread is not allowed to open a socket connection to the
      specified host and port number.
      
      A port number of -1 indicates that the calling
      method is attempting to determine the IP address of the specified
      host name.
      
      This method calls checkPermission with the
      SocketPermission(host+":"+port,"connect") permission if
      the port is not equal to -1. If the port is equal to -1, then
      it calls checkPermission with the
      SocketPermission(host,"resolve") permission.
      
      If you override this method, then you should make a call to
      super.checkConnect
      at the point the overridden method would normally throw an
      exception.
     
      @param      host   the host name port to connect to.
      @param      port   the protocol port to connect to.
      @exception  SecurityException  if the calling thread does not have
                  permission to open a socket connection to the specified
                    host and port.
      @exception  NullPointerException if the host argument is
                  null.
